===========

Usage
-----

Fork this repo, then add / change code in src/index.js as you see fit! There are dependencies included, but you can remove those. Rollup ensures that only code you `import` is included!

- Static files can be configured for copying in [rollup.config.js](./rollup.config.js). Default is just [`src/index.html`](src/index.html)
- Static files that are `import`ed are automatically copied into the `dist/` folder by rollup.
- PNG/ZIP optimizations are handled by scripts in the [tools](/tools) directory. PNGs are handled via tinypng.com, which requires an API key in a file named `.tinypngapi`.

### `yarn start`

Run type checking, rollup, and a local http server in watch mode.

### `yarn zip`

How close are you to the limit? Compiles in production mode, and creates a zip suitable for JS13K in `/dist`!

### `yarn deploy`

Build a zip, then deploy the `dist` folder to `gh-pages` seamlessly! Best for testing your game on multiple devices.

### `yarn http-server dist/`

Done automatically by `yarn start`, but perhaps you just ran `yarn zip` and want to run the actual compiled/mangled code.

### `yarn terser dist/bundle.js --compress --mangle --beautify`

This is a debug tool.

See what the compiled JS will look like, to make sure rollup is treeshaking / hoisting as expected and that dead code is being eliminated. `yarn build` will create a `dist/bundle.js` to use in this command.
